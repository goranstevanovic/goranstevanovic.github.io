      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        My first experience with web development was more than 15 years ago when
        I was in high school. CSS was not well supported yet. Page layouts were
        done with HTML tables. Ah, good times!
      </p>
      <p>
        I didn't continue with web development. I discovered Linux, so I started
        learning as much as possible about how it works and how to administer a
        Linux system.
      </p>
      <p>
        While I was in college, I started learning graphic design, Photoshop,
        Illustrator, and InDesign. That path led me to rediscover web
        development again. This time, though, I didn't quit on it. I learned
        HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (this was before ES2015).
      </p>
      <p>
        It was just the beginning of my learning. Soon I learned a bit of
        jQuery, Python, PHP, SQL, and WordPress. Then it was time to learn
        Node.js, React, TypeScript, and other modern JavaScript bits and pieces.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love to learn and read about various technologies. I still have a lot
        to learn. My learning to-do list grows every day. I'll need at least one
        more life to learn it all.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have never worked in a developer position, but I've used my
        programming knowledge in all my jobs. I realized that I love solving
        problems and writing code. That was the part I enjoyed the most. Now I
        want to transition to a developer role, so I can mainly focus on coding
        and solving problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, I'm looking for a full-time remote role where I can learn
        from my colleagues and help a company achieve its goals.
